# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to modify the previously submitted math and reading scores. The current scores may be erroneous because of academic dishonesty, so it is necessary to remove some data and refactor. Once the data is modified, we refactored to find the overall passing percentages of the students. Doing this showed if there was any correlation with the budget per student. 

## Results
•	The district summary was not affected.<br>
•	Overall passing for Thomas High School declined by 0.3%.<br>
•	Replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores did not affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools.<br>
•	Negligible change to Math and reading scores by grade<br>
•	Negligible change to scores by school spending<br>
•	Negligible change to scores by school size<br>
•	Negligible change to scores by school type<br>

## Summary

After replacing the scores for the 9th graders, there are very few changes. It is our impression that nullifying the values did not alter math and reading scores, scores by school spending, scores by school size or scores by school type of the students, because the 9th grade data was being falsely reported in an effort to have more favorable results.
